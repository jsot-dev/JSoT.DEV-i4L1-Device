## Node.js for Embedded Systems

[Book site](http://embeddednodejs.com)

From book site: The book Node.js for embedded systems explores how a web technology can change the way we build hardware.

Compared to classical programming languages for embedded development, JavaScript embraces open-source collaboration and should help with a good "user" experience. Besides programming concepts, the book provides on overview on embedded hardware that support JavaScript.

From publisher site: How can we build bridges from the digital world of the Internet to the analog world that surrounds us? By bringing accessibility to embedded components such as sensors and microcontrollers, JavaScript and Node.js might shape the world of physical computing as they did for web browsers. This practical guide shows hardware and software engineers, makers, and web developers how to talk in JavaScript with a variety of hardware platforms. Authors Patrick Mulder and Kelsey Breseman also delve into the basics of microcontrollers, single-board computers, and other hardware components.
